      Created my own console, using it to my projects, for my convience. You can try it out, too.
The idea is that after following the steps, down below, by calling the function console.log(), the messages will be appeared in the custom Console and not in the Chrome's console.
Future versions will be posted, so if you are interested, be aware! Any new ideas about its development, will be appreciated.
